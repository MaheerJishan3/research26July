# Breast Cancer Classification with SVM from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier built from scratch to predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision boundary using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Overview

The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. These features describe characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area, among others. A linear SVM is implemented using gradient descent to optimize the hinge loss with L2 regularization, trained to classify tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B). The decision boundary is visualized in a 2D PCA projection.

### Description
Features are derived from a digitized image of an FNA of a breast mass, describing cell nuclei characteristics. The dataset includes:
- **Total Instances**: 569
- **Class Distribution**: 357 benign, 212 malignant
- **Missing Values**: None
- **Feature Details**: 30 real-valued features computed as the mean, standard error, and "worst" (mean of the three largest values) of ten real-valued features:
  1. **Radius**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
  2. **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
  3. **Perimeter**
  4. **Area**
  5. **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths
  6. **Compactness**: (PerimeterÂ² / Area - 1.0)
  7. **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour
  8. **Concave Points**: Number of concave portions of the contour
  9. **Symmetry**
  10. **Fractal Dimension**: "Coastline approximation" - 1

All feature values are recorded with four significant digits.
